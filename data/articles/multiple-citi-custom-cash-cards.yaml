  The Citi Custom Cash card offers an attractive 5% cash back on your highest spending category each billing cycle, up to $500 in purchases. But what if you could earn 5% back on *multiple* categories? The good news is: you can.

  ## The Multi-Card Strategy

  Citi allows cardholders to have **multiple Custom Cash cards** — up to a rumored limit of around 4-5 cards per person. This opens up a powerful strategy for maximizing your cash back rewards.

  ### How It Works

  Each Citi Custom Cash card tracks its own spending independently. So if you have two cards:

  - **Card 1** could earn 5% on groceries
  - **Card 2** could earn 5% on gas stations

  You'd earn 5% back on both categories, effectively doubling your bonus category coverage.

  ## The Eligible 5% Categories

  The Citi Custom Cash earns 5% on whichever of these categories you spend the most in each billing cycle:

  - Restaurants
  - Gas stations
  - Grocery stores
  - Select travel (airlines, hotels, car rentals)
  - Select transit (taxis, rideshare, trains)
  - Select streaming services
  - Drugstores
  - Home improvement stores
  - Fitness clubs
  - Live entertainment

  ## Practical Implementation

  Here's how to set up a multi-card system:

  ### Step 1: Identify Your Top Spending Categories

  Review your spending over the past 3-6 months. Which categories consistently hit or exceed the $500/month threshold? Common candidates include:

  - Groceries ($400-600/month for many families)
  - Gas ($200-400/month for commuters)
  - Dining out ($200-500/month)

  ### Step 2: Apply for Additional Cards

  Space out your applications by 3-6 months to minimize hard inquiry impact. Citi is generally friendly to existing customers, especially those with good payment history.

  ### Step 3: Dedicate Each Card

  Assign each card to a specific category. Some people even label their cards or use card management apps to keep track.

  ## The Math

  Let's say you spend:
  - $500/month on groceries → $25 back (5%)
  - $400/month on gas → $20 back (5%)
  - $300/month on dining → $15 back (5%)

  With three Custom Cash cards, you'd earn **$60/month** or **$720/year** in cash back on these categories alone.

  Compare that to a flat 2% card: the same $1,200 spending would earn just $24/month or $288/year.

  **That's an extra $432/year** from the multi-card strategy.

  ## Considerations

  ### Pros
  - No annual fee on any of the cards
  - 5% is among the highest category rates available
  - Flexibility to adjust as spending patterns change

  ### Cons
  - Managing multiple cards requires organization
  - Each card has a separate $500 cap per billing cycle
  - Too many applications in a short period can hurt your credit

  ## Pairing with Citi Double Cash

  For spending that doesn't fit neatly into the 5% categories, the Citi Double Cash is an excellent companion card. It earns a flat 2% on everything (1% when you buy, 1% when you pay), making it perfect for miscellaneous purchases.

  ## The Bottom Line

  Yes, you can absolutely have multiple Citi Custom Cash cards, and doing so is one of the most effective no-annual-fee cash back strategies available. If you're organized enough to manage multiple cards and your spending aligns with the bonus categories, this approach can significantly boost your rewards.

  Start with one card, get comfortable with the system, then consider adding more as you identify additional high-spend categories in your budget.
